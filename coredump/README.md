# Motivation

There is not a lot of documentation on how a Mach-O coredump is constructed. Most of the Mach-O parsing tools I tried does not seem to give much detail about the coredump file...

Since I need to get `darling-coredump` to generate a working Mach-O ARM64 coredump, this seems like a great opportunity to learn more about a Mach-O coredump (at least for ARM64)
